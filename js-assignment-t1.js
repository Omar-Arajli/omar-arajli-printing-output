/* 
Task 1

Declare three variables, a and b and c.

If a has value 3, b has value 5, and c doesn't have a value, alert the following expressions 
( one after another ). Alert popup box has to show the following content for each expression
(concatenate everything in one long expression using "\n" to make new lines):

a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
a % b
a += b
a -= b
a *= b
a /= b
a %= b
a == b
a != b
a > b
a < b
!a && !c 
!a || !c 
*/


let a = 3;
let b = 5;
let c;


let outpout = "let a = 3;\nlet b = 5;\nlet c\n----------";

alert (outpout + "\n\na + b = " + (a + b) + "\na - b = " + (a - b) + "\na * b = " + (a * b) + "\na / b = " + (a / b) + "\na % b = " + (a % b) + "\na += b = " + (a += b) + "\na -= b = " + (a -= b) + "\na *= b = " + (a *= b)+ "\na /= b = " + (a /= b)+ "\na %= b = " + (a %= b) + "\na == b = " + (a == b) + "\na != b = " + (a != b) + "\na > b = " + (a > b) + "\na < b = " + (a < b) + "\n!a && !c = " + (!a && !c) + "\n!a || !c  = " + (!a || !c ) + "\n\n" );
